### Cross 
Cross platform build for Linux, Mac, Windows, Web, Android and iOS

### Why?
R&D project for future contract, performance benchmarking

## egui: 
egui seems like a top choice but the mobile build is rough to get for now so I might consider something else in the future
### Native
Just works

### Web (fill assets)
Run in browser with trunk:  
```
trunk serve 
```

### Android (WIP)
